# Glogging
Glogging is a set of utilities around the tedious process of moving log files around

One of the tasks that I continually deal with as an appliction developer, is having to move log files around.  Glogging is my attempt to write a focused utility for moving files around.  Right now, a "find" command call is probably more useful, but eventually this utility will support:

* Regular Expressions
* Time based filters
* file copy over scp
* AWS integration
* email reports
